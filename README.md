# Animate Video

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

## Problem

Animating between views works when the video isn't playing but if autoplaying is enabled the view appears instantly.

## How to use this example

1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`
3. Press "Next page" to see that the animation works
4. Switch to the first video element in `src/app/two/two.component.html` and have a look at the animation again.
